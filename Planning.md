# Project Planning Demo User Stories

## User Story 1
- **Feature Title:** Signup Page
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to sign up, so that I can have a personalized experience on the website.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 
    - The signup page displays the necessary form fields (name, email, password, and repeat password).
    - Each input field has client-side validation. (Example: Email format, password strength, matching passwords.)
    - The collected signup data is saved in a local JSON file.
    - Error Handling: The page clearly displays appropriate error messages to the user if there's an issue with the form submission. (e.g., email already exists, invalid email format, password mismatch).
    - The signup page is responsive, displaying correctly on various device sizes.

- **Tasks:** 
    - Create the signup page's HTML structure and style it using CSS. Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.
    - Implement JavaScript functions to validate the signup form data according to the acceptance criteria (email format, password strength, matching passwords).
    - Check if the submitted email already exists in the local JSON data store.
    - Use appropriate data structures (objects) to store user data within the JSON file.
